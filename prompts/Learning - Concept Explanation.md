# Learning - Concept Explanation

## Prompt
```
Explain {concept_or_topic} to me as if I'm {experience_level}.

**Learning context**:
- My background: {relevant_background}
- Why I need to learn this: {purpose_or_goal}
- Preferred learning style: {visual/auditory/hands-on/reading}

**Explanation requirements**:
1. Start with a simple definition in one sentence
2. Use an analogy or real-world example I can relate to
3. Break down the key components or steps
4. Show a practical example or use case
5. Explain common misconceptions or gotchas
6. Suggest next steps for deeper learning

**Format preferences**:
- Use bullet points for key concepts
- Include concrete examples
- Avoid jargon unless you define it
- Make it actionable - what can I do with this knowledge?

If this is a complex topic, break it into digestible chunks and suggest a learning sequence.
```

## Context
- **Best for**: Learning new concepts, preparing for teaching others
- **Avoid when**: You need highly technical or specialized explanations
- **Typical length**: 300-600 words depending on concept complexity

## Variables
- `{concept_or_topic}`: The subject you want to understand
- `{experience_level}`: beginner, intermediate, advanced, or specific role
- `{relevant_background}`: Your existing knowledge that might help
- `{purpose_or_goal}`: Why you're learning this
- `{learning_style}`: How you learn best

## Example Usage
**Input**:
```
