# Creative - Brainstorming

## Prompt
```
Help me brainstorm ideas for {specific_challenge_or_goal}.

**Context**:
- Current situation: {background_information}
- Constraints: {limitations_or_requirements}
- Success looks like: {desired_outcomes}
- Resources available: {time_budget_people_tools}

**Brainstorming approach**:
1. Generate 10-15 diverse ideas (don't filter yet)
2. Include both conventional and unconventional approaches
3. Consider different perspectives: {stakeholder1}, {stakeholder2}, {stakeholder3}
4. Think about solutions that are: immediate/long-term, low-cost/high-investment, simple/complex

**For each idea, provide**:
- Brief description (1-2 sentences)
- Potential impact (High/Medium/Low)
- Implementation difficulty (Easy/Moderate/Hard)
- One key advantage

**Follow up with**:
- Top 3 recommendations with reasoning
- Potential combinations of ideas
- Next steps for exploring the best options

Be creative and think outside conventional approaches. No idea is too wild for initial brainstorming.
```

## Context
- **Best for**: Stuck on problems, need fresh perspectives, exploring options
- **Avoid when**: You need detailed implementation plans (use this first, then plan)
- **Typical length**: 400-800 words with structured idea list

## Variables
- `{specific_challenge_or_goal}`: The problem or opportunity you're addressing
- `{background_information}`: Relevant context and history
- `{limitations_or_requirements}`: Constraints to work within
- `{desired_outcomes}`: What success looks like
- `{stakeholder1/2/3}`: Different perspectives to consider

## Example Usage
**Input**:
```
