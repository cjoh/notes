# Week 3 Coaching Manual — Energy & Environment Optimization (Coach Edition, 50 min)

*A warm, practical coaching session for emerging adult men. We're keeping everything bite-sized and permission-based!*

---

## Coach Quick-Start (your pre-session cheat sheet!)

**What Week 3 is really about:** We're dialing in the foundational elements that make everything else easier—sleep windows, movement minimums, workspace setup, phone boundaries, and one tiny social connection goal. You're not here to overhaul their entire life—you're here to help them create conditions where focus and energy happen naturally.

**The vibe you're going for:** Think wise personal trainer who also knows about sleep science. Warm, evidence-based, and super practical. You're helping them build the foundation that makes Week 1 and 2 skills actually sustainable.

**This week's victory lap looks like:**
Your client ends the session with a realistic sleep window, a 15-minute movement minimum, one workspace improvement completed during the call, a simple "phone-out" routine, and one tiny social goal they'll actually follow through on. We're building the engine that powers everything else.

### Before your client arrives (3-minute prep)
1. Have their Weekly Dashboard ready to review together for wins from last week
2. Have ready to screen share: Sleep Window Planner, Movement Menu, Workspace Audit, Phone-Out Routine, Social Connection Goal
3. Your golden rule: "We're optimizing for energy, not perfection. Small improvements compound fast!"

### Your opening line (feel free to make it your own)

"Hey! So today we're going to dial in the fundamentals that make everything else easier—your sleep window, movement minimum, workspace setup, phone boundaries, and one social connection goal. We're not trying to become monks here—just creating conditions where your brain has the energy and environment it needs to actually focus. And we'll test one workspace improvement right now during our call. Sound good?"

### Five simple concepts you're sharing
• **Sleep windows:** Consistent bedtime/wake ranges (not rigid schedules) that work with your natural rhythm
• **Movement minimums:** 15 minutes daily that count as "movement"—walking, stretching, anything that gets blood flowing
• **Workspace optimization:** Simple environmental changes that reduce friction and distraction
• **Phone boundaries:** Clear "phone-out" times and spaces that protect your focus
• **Social scaffolding:** One tiny weekly social goal that builds connection and accountability

### What success actually looks like today
• A realistic sleep window that they'll actually stick to (like "in bed by 11:30pm, awake by 7:30am")
• A 15-minute movement commitment that feels totally doable ("walk around the block after lunch")
• One workspace improvement completed during the session (cleared desk, phone charging station, etc.)
• A simple "phone-out" routine for focus time ("phone goes in kitchen drawer during work blocks")
• One tiny social goal they'll follow through on ("text one friend to grab coffee this week")

### Common hiccups & your quick saves
• **"I'm not a morning person"** → Let's work with your natural rhythm. When do you actually feel most awake? Let's build around that.
• **"I don't have time to exercise"** → Walking to get coffee counts. Taking stairs counts. 15 minutes is less than one TikTok scroll session.
• **"My space is too small"** → We can optimize any space. Sometimes it's just moving your phone charger to another room.
• **"I'm not social"** → One text message counts. Saying hi to a neighbor counts. We're building the muscle, not hosting parties.

## Quick Safety Check (30 seconds, but important!)
• Remember: You're teaching skills and building routines, not diagnosing or treating anything
• If safety concerns come up (harm to self/others, medical stuff, substance issues), pause and help them connect with the right professional
• If they have a therapist, you can coordinate with permission—you're all on the same team!

**Your simple explanation:** "I'm here to help you build practical routines and habits. If something medical or safety-related comes up, I'll help you find the right professional for that."

## What We're Actually Accomplishing Today

By the end of this session, your client will:
1. Establish a realistic sleep window that works with their natural rhythm and lifestyle
2. Choose a 15-minute daily movement minimum that feels totally achievable
3. Complete one workspace optimization during the call (clearing desk, setting up phone charging station, etc.)
4. Create a simple "phone-out" routine for protecting focus time
5. Set one tiny social connection goal for the week

**Quick vocab guide:** Sleep window = consistent bedtime/wake ranges (not rigid times) | Movement minimum = 15 minutes of any physical activity that counts | Workspace optimization = environmental changes that reduce friction | Phone-out routine = specific times/places where phone is away | Social scaffolding = tiny weekly social goals that build connection

---

## What You'll Need
• Worksheets: Sleep Window Planner, Movement Menu, Workspace Audit Checklist, Phone-Out Routine Guide, Social Connection Goal Sheet, Weekly Dashboard (Lite)
• Their phone/calendar, and something to write with
• Comfy seating arrangement where you can both see the materials (and access to their workspace for the optimization exercise)

## Your 50-Minute Game Plan (with friendly scripts!)

### 0–3 min | Quick connection
• "What's been going well since we last talked?" (Jot one win on the Dashboard)
• "How's your energy been lately? Any patterns you've noticed?" (Keep it brief—we're solution-focused!)

### 3–8 min | Remember the 'why'
• "Which area feels most important this week—school/work, health, relationships, money, or purpose?"
• "If you had more consistent energy and better focus, what would change first?" (Just one sentence!)

### 8–15 min | Sleep Window: finding your rhythm
• Using the Sleep Window Planner:
  - "When do you naturally start feeling tired? When do you naturally wake up on weekends?"
  - Create a realistic window (like "in bed 11:00-11:30pm, awake 7:00-7:30am")
  - "What's one tiny thing that would make bedtime easier?" (phone in other room, clothes laid out, etc.)
• Your mantra: "We're optimizing for consistency, not perfection!"

### 15–22 min | Movement Minimum: 15 minutes that count
• Using the Movement Menu, pick what feels totally doable:
  - Walking (to coffee shop, around block, during phone calls)
  - Stretching/yoga (morning routine, between classes, before bed)
  - Active chores (cleaning while dancing, taking stairs, standing desk)
• Add it to their calendar as a daily 15-minute block
• "What counts as your movement win for today?"

### 22–30 min | Workspace Optimization: let's do this now!
• Quick workspace audit together (where they usually work)
• Pick ONE improvement to do right now during the call:
  - Clear the desk surface
  - Set up phone charging station in another room
  - Create a "focus mode" setup (water, notebook, good lighting)
• "What's the one thing that would make starting work feel easier?"

### 30–38 min | Phone-Out Routine: creating boundaries
• Design a simple phone boundary system:
  - During focus blocks: "Phone goes in [specific location] on Do Not Disturb"
  - Before bed: "Phone charges in [kitchen/living room] starting at [time]"
  - One "phone-free" meal or activity per day
• Test it right now—have them put phone away for rest of session

### 38–42 min | Social Connection: one tiny goal
• Pick ONE social action for this week:
  - Text one friend to grab coffee/lunch
  - Say hi to one neighbor or classmate
  - Join one group activity (study group, gym class, hobby meet-up)
• Put it on the calendar with a specific day and time
• "What's the easiest way for you to connect with people?"

### 42–47 min | Integration check: how it all works together
• Quick review: "So you've got your sleep window, movement minimum, workspace setup, phone boundaries, and social goal"
• "How do you think these will impact your ability to focus and follow through on work?"
• Identify the ONE thing that feels most important to nail this week

### 47–49 min | Lock in the commitments
• Choose 1–3 micro-commitments from the library below (put them right on the calendar!)
• Set up Mon/Wed/Fri check-ins (just a photo of their sleep/movement/workspace wins)

### 49–50 min | Confidence check & encouragement
• "On a scale of 0–10, how confident are you feeling about these changes?" If it's under 7 → make something smaller
• "Remember, this week is about building the foundation that makes everything else easier. Small improvements compound fast!"

---

## Micro-Commitments Menu (Week 3)

Pick 1–3 that feel totally doable (should be at least 7/10 confidence):
• Follow your sleep window 5 out of 7 nights this week
• Hit your 15-minute movement minimum 5 out of 7 days
• Keep your workspace optimization in place all week
• Use phone-out routine during work time 3+ times this week
• Complete your one social connection goal by Friday
• Take a photo of your optimized workspace and send it by Wednesday

---

## Their Homework (keeping it simple!)
1. Follow your sleep window and track it (send photo of sleep log M/W/F)
2. Hit your 15-minute movement minimum and note what you did
3. Maintain your workspace optimization and use phone-out routine
4. Complete your social connection goal by Friday
5. Update the Weekly Dashboard each evening (takes 30 seconds, seriously)

**Week 3 success looks like:** Sleep window followed 5+ nights, movement minimum hit 5+ days, workspace stayed optimized, social goal completed, dashboard updated most days

---

## Your Troubleshooting Toolkit
• **Can't stick to sleep window?** Move bedtime 15 minutes later, focus on consistency over perfection, address what's keeping them up (phone, anxiety, caffeine)
• **Skipping movement?** Make it smaller (5-10 minutes), attach it to existing habit (after coffee, before lunch), count walking to places
• **Workspace keeps getting messy?** Daily 2-minute tidy, one-touch rule (touch it once, deal with it), identify what's creating the mess
• **Phone boundaries failing?** Physical distance is key, remove tempting apps from home screen, find better phone charging location, use airplane mode
