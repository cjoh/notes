        <h1>Week 1 Coaching Manual — Orientation & Values → Goals (Coach Edition, 50 min)</h1>

<em>A warm, practical first session for emerging adult men ready to build better follow-through, healthier tech habits, and real connection. This is coaching, not therapy—we're keeping things light, doable, and always permission-based!</em>

<hr>

<h2>Quick Safety Check & Your Role (share this in your own style!)</h2>

<p>* <strong>What you're here for:</strong> You're teaching skills, building routines, and providing friendly accountability. You're not diagnosing or treating anything—you're more like a really organized friend who helps people get stuff done.</p>

<p>* <strong>When to pause and refer:</strong> If safety concerns come up (self-harm, violence, medical emergencies, substance issues), you pause and help them find the right professional support. Always with their permission.</p>

<p>* <strong>Team player mode:</strong> If they have a therapist or doctor, you can coordinate (with permission). You share goals and wins, not symptoms—you're all rowing in the same direction!</p>

<p>* <strong>Your go-to explanation:</strong> "I'm here to help you build simple systems and daily habits that actually stick. If something medical or clinical comes up, I'll help you connect with the right professional for that."</p>

<hr>

<h2>Your Quick Reference Guide (plain English, no jargon!)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Values</strong> → Simple words that describe who they want to be (like <em>reliable, active, connected</em>)</li>
<li><strong>90-Day Outcome</strong> → Something real and measurable tied to their values that they can achieve in ~3 months</li>
<li><strong>Minimum System</strong> → The simplest toolkit that works: one calendar + one task list + a 5-minute daily planning habit</li>
<li><strong>5-Minute Daily Plan</strong> → Their morning micro-routine: check calendar, pick 1–3 tasks for today, write the first tiny step for each</li>
<li><strong>Activation Rep</strong> → A 10-minute practice run on a real task (we do this together in session!)</li>
<li><strong>Micro-Commitment</strong> → A tiny promise for this week they're at least 70% sure they can keep</li>
<li><strong>If-Then Plan</strong> → Their pre-planned response to predictable obstacles</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Dashboard</strong> → A super simple tracking system (takes 30 seconds to update daily)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Before Your Client Arrives (your 5-minute prep)</h2>

<strong>Send this message (24–48h before):</strong> "Looking forward to our Zoom session! Please have your phone with calendar and task app access ready. We'll set up a simple system and practice getting started on something real. I'll send you the worksheet links during our call."

<strong>Set up your virtual space:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Good lighting and camera angle</li>
<li>Timer/clock visible to you</li>
<li>Digital materials ready: Values→Goals worksheet, Daily 5-Minute Plan, Micro-Commitments card, Weekly Dashboard</li>
<li>Screen sharing capability enabled</li>
<li>Backup plan for tech issues</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>What Success Looks Like Today</h2>

By the end of this first session, your client will:
<ol>
<li>Identify 2–3 personal values and turn two of them into concrete 90-day outcomes</li>
<li>Set up their minimum system (one calendar, one task list, daily planning habit)</li>
<li>Actually do a 10-minute work session during the call with you</li>
<li>Choose 1–3 tiny commitments for the week and know exactly when they'll happen</li>
<li>Have a simple dashboard to track their progress (no complicated apps needed!)</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Your 50-Minute Game Plan (with natural scripts!)</h2>

<em>Follow this flow: Welcome → Why it matters → Plan → Practice → Commit → Close</em>

<h3 class="time-header">0–3 min — Welcome & Set the Tone</h3>

<strong>What to say (make it your own!):</strong> "Hey! Welcome! Today we're going to set up a really simple system that makes doing the right things way easier. Everything we try will be small and totally doable—and you can veto anything that doesn't feel right."

<strong>What to do:</strong> Set your 50-minute timer, share your screen with worksheets ready, create a collaborative vibe.

<h3 class="time-header">3–7 min — "What Would Make Today a Win?"</h3>

<strong>Ask:</strong> "If our session today is a total success, what's different by tonight or tomorrow morning? What would you notice?"

<strong>Do:</strong> Write down 1–2 immediate wins in their exact words (like <em>"I'll have two job search blocks on my calendar"</em> or <em>"I'll text my friend about working out"</em>). Mirror their language back.

<h3 class="time-header">7–10 min — Why This Matters (Finding Their Values)</h3>

<strong>Ask:</strong> "Over the next few months, what kind of person do you want to be when it comes to... work or school? Health? Relationships? Money? Purpose or meaning?"

<strong>Do:</strong> Capture 2–3 values as simple words. If they're stuck, offer options: "Does something like <em>reliable</em>, <em>active</em>, or <em>connected</em> resonate with you?"

<h3 class="time-header">10–20 min — Turn Values into Real Outcomes</h3>

<strong>Explain:</strong> "Cool, so now let's turn those values into something we can actually see happening in real life."

<strong>Do together:</strong> For two values, create one specific outcome each:
<ul>
<li><em>Reliable worker</em> → "Submit 8 job applications by [date]"</li>
<li><em>Active</em> → "Work out twice a week for 10 weeks"</li>
<li><em>Connected</em> → "Go to Tuesday group at least 8 out of 12 weeks"</li>
</ul>

<strong>If they say something vague like "get healthy":</strong> "Love it! What would I actually see on your calendar or in your routine when that's happening?"

<h3 class="time-header">20–30 min — Build the Minimum System (hands-on time!)</h3>

<strong>Explain:</strong> "Now we're going to make taking action super easy by setting up a simple system."

<strong>Do this together (via screen sharing):</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>Calendar setup:</strong> Create two recurring blocks this week for something tied to their values (like "Tue/Thu 10:00–10:30 Job Applications"). Set alerts for 5 minutes before!</li>
<li><strong>Task list:</strong> Make a "Next Actions" list with three tiny tasks (like "open resume file," "list 3 job sites," "write opening sentence of cover letter")</li>
<li><strong>Daily Planning:</strong> Teach them the 5-minute morning routine and have them do it right now:</li>
</ol>
   - Check calendar → confirm today's blocks
   - Pick 1–3 tasks for today
   - Write the first 2-minute step for each

<strong>Your mantra:</strong> "If it feels too big, we just cut it in half!"

<h3 class="time-header">30–40 min — Practice Time! (The Activation Rep)</h3>

<strong>Explain:</strong> "Okay, now we're going to practice actually starting. Just 10 minutes. Remember—ugly first drafts are perfect!"

<strong>Do:</strong> Set a 10-minute timer. They do their first 2-minute step, then keep going if they want. You stay on mute and observe—only jump in if they hit a roadblock or ask for help.

<strong>If their phone distracts them:</strong> "Notice that pull, flip your phone face-down, and hop back to your tiny step."

<strong>Quick debrief after:</strong> "Nice work! What made it easier to start? What got in the way? What would you do differently next time?"

<h3 class="time-header">40–47 min — Lock in This Week's Micro-Commitments</h3>

<strong>Explain:</strong> "These tiny promises we keep to ourselves are how we build a new identity."

<strong>Do:</strong> They pick 1–3 commitments from your menu (see below). Help them put each one on their calendar with a reminder via screen sharing. Set up check-ins: "Can you text me a photo of your daily plan on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?"

<h3 class="time-header">47–50 min — Confidence Check & Send-off</h3>

<strong>Ask:</strong> "On a scale of 0–10, how confident are you that you'll do this?" If it's under 7 → make something smaller!

<strong>Your closing line:</strong> "Remember, this week is just an experiment. We're going to learn what works for you and adjust as we go. You've got this!"

<hr>

<h2>Micro-Commitments Menu (they pick 1–3)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do one 10-minute "ugly first draft" session on school/work</li>
<li>Send one text to set up a casual hangout or workout</li>
<li>Apply to one job OR complete one step on a school project</li>
<li>Take a 20-minute walk twice this week</li>
<li>Charge phone outside the bedroom 3 nights</li>
</ul>

<strong>Coach tip:</strong> Focus on specific counts ("2 walks," "3 nights"), not daily perfection!

<hr>

<h2>The Super Simple Weekly Dashboard</h2>

Have them track this in their Notes app (or you can send them a digital template). Takes less than a minute per day:
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy (0–10)</strong> and <strong>Focus (0–10)</strong> — quick daily rating</li>
<li><strong>Screen time</strong> — check the built-in phone tracker</li>
<li><strong>Habits kept</strong> — Plan done? Y/N • 10-min session? Y/N • Sleep schedule? Y/N</li>
<li><strong>Win of the day</strong> — one sentence about something good</li>
</ul>

<p>Check this together each week—no judgment, just useful data!</p>

<hr>

<h2>Your Troubleshooting Toolkit</h2>

<strong>"I'm just not motivated"</strong> → "I hear you. What's the absolute smallest step that feels maybe 70% doable? Want to try 2 minutes right now, or schedule it for 11am tomorrow?"

<strong>Phone addiction</strong> → Time for friction! Remove tempting apps from home screen, turn on Focus mode, try grayscale, create an If-Then rule: "If I pick up my phone during work → I open my task app and do one tiny step"

<strong>Perfectionism paralysis</strong> → "We're counting starts, not measuring perfection. Ugly first drafts are the goal!"

<strong>Social anxiety</strong> → Start super small: one text to a safe person, or sign up for one low-key event

<strong>Safety concerns (rare but important)</strong> → "This is beyond what coaching covers. Let's get you connected with the right support" + provide referral options

<hr>

<h2>Working with Their Care Team</h2>

<p>"If you'd like, I can share your goals and progress with your therapist/doctor so we're all supporting you in the same direction. Totally your call!"</p>

<p>Remember: You share behaviors and wins, not symptoms or diagnoses. Keep it action-focused!</p>
