# Week 1 Coaching Manual — Orientation & Values → Goals (Coach Edition, 50 min)

*A warm, practical first session for emerging adult men ready to build better follow-through, healthier tech habits, and real connection. This is coaching, not therapy—we're keeping things light, doable, and always permission-based!*

---

## Quick Safety Check & Your Role (share this in your own style!)

* **What you're here for:** You're teaching skills, building routines, and providing friendly accountability. You're not diagnosing or treating anything—you're more like a really organized friend who helps people get stuff done.

* **When to pause and refer:** If safety concerns come up (self-harm, violence, medical emergencies, substance issues), you pause and help them find the right professional support. Always with their permission.

* **Team player mode:** If they have a therapist or doctor, you can coordinate (with permission). You share goals and wins, not symptoms—you're all rowing in the same direction!

* **Your go-to explanation:** "I'm here to help you build simple systems and daily habits that actually stick. If something medical or clinical comes up, I'll help you connect with the right professional for that."

## Your Quick Reference Guide (plain English, no jargon!)

- **Values** → Simple words that describe who they want to be (like *reliable, active, connected*)
- **90-Day Outcome** → Something real and measurable tied to their values that they can achieve in ~3 months
- **Minimum System** → The simplest toolkit that works: one calendar + one task list + a 5-minute daily planning habit
- **5-Minute Daily Plan** → Their morning micro-routine: check calendar, pick 1–3 tasks for today, write the first tiny step for each
- **Activation Rep** → A 10-minute practice run on a real task (we do this together in session!)
- **Micro-Commitment** → A tiny promise for this week they're at least 70% sure they can keep
- **If-Then Plan** → Their pre-planned response to predictable obstacles
- **Weekly Dashboard** → A super simple tracking system (takes 30 seconds to update daily)

## What Success Looks Like Today

By the end of this first session, your client will:
1. Identify 2–3 personal values and turn two of them into concrete 90-day outcomes
2. Set up their minimum system (one calendar, one task list, daily planning habit)
3. Actually do a 10-minute work session during the call with you
4. Choose 1–3 tiny commitments for the week and know exactly when they'll happen
5. Have a simple dashboard to track their progress (no complicated apps needed!)

## Your 50-Minute Game Plan (with natural scripts!)

*Follow this flow: Welcome → Why it matters → Plan → Practice → Commit → Close*

### 0–3 min — Welcome & Set the Tone

**What to say (make it your own!):** "Hey! Welcome! Today we're going to set up a really simple system that makes doing the right things way easier. Everything we try will be small and totally doable—and you can veto anything that doesn't feel right."

**What to do:** Set your 50-minute timer, share your screen with worksheets ready, create a collaborative vibe.

### 3–7 min — "What Would Make Today a Win?"

**Ask:** "If our session today is a total success, what's different by tonight or tomorrow morning? What would you notice?"

**Do:** Write down 1–2 immediate wins in their exact words (like *"I'll have two job search blocks on my calendar"* or *"I'll text my friend about working out"*). Mirror their language back.

### 7–10 min — Why This Matters (Finding Their Values)

**Ask:** "Over the next few months, what kind of person do you want to be when it comes to... work or school? Health? Relationships? Money? Purpose or meaning?"

**Do:** Capture 2–3 values as simple words. If they're stuck, offer options: "Does something like *reliable*, *active*, or *connected* resonate with you?"

### 10–20 min — Turn Values into Real Outcomes

**Explain:** "Cool, so now let's turn those values into something we can actually see happening in real life."

**Do together:** For two values, create one specific outcome each:
- *Reliable worker* → "Submit 8 job applications by [date]"
- *Active* → "Work out twice a week for 10 weeks"
- *Connected* → "Go to Tuesday group at least 8 out of 12 weeks"

**If they say something vague like "get healthy":** "Love it! What would I actually see on your calendar or in your routine when that's happening?"

### 20–30 min — Build the Minimum System (hands-on time!)

**Explain:** "Now we're going to make taking action super easy by setting up a simple system."

**Do this together (via screen sharing):**

1. **Calendar setup:** Create two recurring blocks this week for something tied to their values (like "Tue/Thu 10:00–10:30 Job Applications"). Set alerts for 5 minutes before!

2. **Task list:** Make a "Next Actions" list with three tiny tasks (like "open resume file," "list 3 job sites," "write opening sentence of cover letter")

3. **Daily Planning:** Teach them the 5-minute morning routine and have them do it right now:
   - Check calendar → confirm today's blocks
   - Pick 1–3 tasks for today
   - Write the first 2-minute step for each

**Your mantra:** "If it feels too big, we just cut it in half!"

### 30–40 min — Practice Time! (The Activation Rep)

**Explain:** "Okay, now we're going to practice actually starting. Just 10 minutes. Remember—ugly first drafts are perfect!"

**Do:** Set a 10-minute timer. They do their first 2-minute step, then keep going if they want. You stay on mute and observe—only jump in if they hit a roadblock or ask for help.

**If their phone distracts them:** "Notice that pull, flip your phone face-down, and hop back to your tiny step."

**Quick debrief after:** "Nice work! What made it easier to start? What got in the way? What would you do differently next time?"

### 40–47 min — Lock in This Week's Micro-Commitments

**Explain:** "These tiny promises we keep to ourselves are how we build a new identity."

**Do:** They pick 1–3 commitments from your menu (see below). Help them put each one on their calendar with a reminder via screen sharing. Set up check-ins: "Can you text me a photo of your daily plan on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?"

### 47–50 min — Confidence Check & Send-off

**Ask:** "On a scale of 0–10, how confident are you that you'll do this?" If it's under 7 → make something smaller!

**Your closing line:** "Remember, this week is just an experiment. We're going to learn what works for you and adjust as we go. You've got this!"

---

## Micro-Commitments Menu (they pick 1–3)

- Do one 10-minute "ugly first draft" session on school/work
- Send one text to set up a casual hangout or workout
- Apply to one job OR complete one step on a school project
- Take a 20-minute walk twice this week
- Charge phone outside the bedroom 3 nights

**Coach tip:** Focus on specific counts ("2 walks," "3 nights"), not daily perfection!

---

## The Super Simple Weekly Dashboard

Have them track this in their Notes app (or you can send them a digital template). Takes less than a minute per day:
- **Energy (0–10)** and **Focus (0–10)** — quick daily rating
- **Screen time** — check the built-in phone tracker
- **Habits kept** — Plan done? Y/N • 10-min session? Y/N • Sleep schedule? Y/N
- **Win of the day** — one sentence about something good

Check this together each week—no judgment, just useful data!

---

## Your Troubleshooting Toolkit

**"I'm just not motivated"** → "I hear you. What's the absolute smallest step that feels maybe 70% doable? Want to try 2 minutes right now, or schedule it for 11am tomorrow?"

**Phone addiction** → Time for friction! Remove tempting apps from home screen, turn on Focus mode, try grayscale, create an If-Then rule: "If I pick up my phone during work → I open my task app and do one tiny step"

**Perfectionism paralysis** → "We're counting starts, not measuring perfection. Ugly first drafts are the goal!"

**Social anxiety** → Start super small: one text to a safe person, or sign up for one low-key event

**Safety concerns (rare but important)** → "This is beyond what coaching covers. Let's get you connected with the right support" + provide referral options

---

## Working with Their Care Team

"If you'd like, I can share your goals and progress with your therapist/doctor so we're all supporting you in the same direction. Totally your call!"

Remember: You share behaviors and wins, not symptoms or diagnoses. Keep it action-focused!
