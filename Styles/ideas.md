# Ideas Style Guide

When capturing ideas, brainstorming, or exploring possibilities:

## Capture Philosophy

- **Speed over perfection**: Get ideas down quickly
- **No judgment**: Record everything, evaluate later
- **Connection-focused**: Look for links between concepts
- **Future-oriented**: Think about potential and possibilities

## Format Patterns

### Quick Capture
```
💡 Idea: [Brief description]
- Why interesting: [1-2 sentences]
- Potential: [What could this become?]
- Next step: [Single action item]
```

### Exploration Format
```
What if...
- We could [possibility]
- This led to [outcome]
- Combined with [other idea]

Questions to explore:
- How might this work with...?
- What would happen if...?
- Could we combine this with...?
```

### Brainstorm Lists
```
Topic: [Main theme]
───────────────────
• Wild idea 1
• Conservative approach
• What [person] might suggest
• Opposite of conventional wisdom
• If resources were unlimited
• Simplest possible version
• Most ambitious version
```

## Language Style

- **Enthusiastic tone**: "This could be amazing if..."
- **Open-ended**: "Maybe we could..." rather than "We should..."
- **Possibility-focused**: "Imagine if..." "What about..."
- **Build on ideas**: "Yes, and..." thinking
- **Question everything**: "Why not...?" "How else...?"

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Timing**: Is now the right time?
- **Alignment**: Does this fit with goals?
- **Excitement**: Does this energize you?
