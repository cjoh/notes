# Outlines Style Guide

When creating outlines for projects, articles, or complex topics:

## Structure Principles

- **Hierarchical organization**: Main points → Sub-points → Details
- **Parallel construction**: Keep items at the same level grammatically consistent
- **Logical flow**: Arrange points in order of importance or chronology
- **Complete thoughts**: Each point should be a self-contained idea

## Formatting Standards

```
I. Main Topic
   A. Primary subtopic
      1. Supporting detail
      2. Supporting detail
         a. Sub-detail
         b. Sub-detail
   B. Primary subtopic
      1. Supporting detail
      2. Supporting detail
```

## Content Guidelines

### Use Action Words
- Start points with verbs when describing tasks or processes
- Use nouns for concept-based outlines
- Keep consistent within each outline type

### Be Specific
- Include concrete details, not vague statements
- Add context where needed (dates, metrics, examples)
- Note dependencies or prerequisites

### Maintain Balance
- Aim for 2-5 items per level
- If only one sub-point exists, incorporate it into the parent
- Keep similar depth across parallel sections

## Types of Outlines

### Topic Outline
```
Machine Learning Fundamentals
├── Supervised Learning
│   ├── Classification algorithms
│   └── Regression techniques
├── Unsupervised Learning
│   ├── Clustering methods
│   └── Dimensionality reduction
└── Reinforcement Learning
    ├── Q-learning
    └── Policy gradient methods
```

### Process Outline
```
Building a Web Application
1. Plan architecture
   - Define requirements
   - Choose tech stack
   - Design database schema
2. Set up development environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure build tools
   - Set up version control
3. Implement features
   - Build backend API
   - Create frontend interface
   - Add authentication
```

### Question-Based Outline
```
Understanding Neural Networks
- What are neural networks?
  • Definition and core concepts
  • Biological inspiration
- How do they learn?
  • Forward propagation
  • Backpropagation
  • Gradient descent
- Where are they used?
  • Computer vision
  • Natural language processing
  • Time series prediction
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with major themes before adding details
2. **Use consistent markers**: Don't mix bullet styles within the same outline
3. **Include action items**: Mark items that need follow-up with [TODO] or similar
4. **Cross-reference**: Link to related notes or resources
5. **Keep it scannable**: Someone should understand the structure at a glance
