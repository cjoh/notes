# Note-Taking Style Guide

When creating or editing notes in this vault, follow these guidelines:

## Structure and Format

- **Clear headings**: Use hierarchical headings (##, ###) to organize content
- **Bullet points**: Prefer bullet lists for easy scanning
- **Short paragraphs**: Keep paragraphs concise (2-3 sentences max)
- **Bold key concepts**: Use **bold** for important terms and definitions
- **Code blocks**: Use fenced code blocks with language specifiers for examples

## Writing Style

- **Direct and concise**: Get to the point quickly
- **Active voice**: Use active constructions
- **Present tense**: Write in present tense for timeless concepts
- **Examples first**: Lead with concrete examples, then explain theory
- **No fluff**: Avoid unnecessary introductions or conclusions

## Linking and References

- **Liberal linking**: Create [[internal links]] generously
- **Link on first mention**: Link concepts when first introduced
- **Create placeholder notes**: Use [[Future Topic]] for topics to explore later

## Key Principles

1. **Atomic notes**: One concept per note
2. **Self-contained**: Each note should stand alone
3. **Evergreen**: Write notes that remain relevant over time
4. **Personal understanding**: Write as if explaining to your future self

## Examples

Good:
```markdown
## Python Decorators

Decorators modify functions without changing their code:

```python
@timer
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(1)
```

The `@timer` decorator adds timing functionality to `slow_function()`.
```

Avoid:
- Long introductions
- Academic language
- Passive voice
- Nested complexity
