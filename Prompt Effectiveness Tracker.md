## Improvement Strategies

### Common Issues & Solutions
**Vague responses** → Add more specific context variables
**Too generic** → Include industry/domain-specific requirements  
**Wrong tone** → Specify audience and communication style
**Missing key points** → Use numbered requirements or checklists
**Too long/short** → Set explicit length parameters

### Optimization Patterns
1. **Context is king**: More specific context = better results
2. **Examples work**: Include example inputs/outputs when possible
3. **Constraints help**: Clear limitations guide better responses
4. **Iteration pays off**: Refine based on actual usage patterns
5. **Audience matters**: Tailor language and depth to intended users
