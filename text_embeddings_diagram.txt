TEXT EMBEDDINGS VISUAL EXPLANATION
==================================

1. PROCESS FLOW:
----------------
   "I love programming"
           |
           v
   ╔═══════════════════╗
   ║  Embedding Model  ║  (BERT, GPT-3, Word2Vec, etc.)
   ║   (Neural Net)    ║
   ╚═══════════════════╝
           |
           v
   [0.8, 0.2, 0.5, ..., 0.3]  (Vector of 768 dimensions)


2. EMBEDDING SPACE (2D Simplified View):
----------------------------------------
    ^
    |     "Weather is nice"
    |           ○
    |
    |    "I love programming" ● ——— ● "I enjoy coding"
    |                         \   /
    |                          \ /
    |                           ● "I like software"
    |
    |        ● "I hate bugs"
    +————————————————————————————————>

    Note: Similar meanings cluster together!


3. SIMILARITY CALCULATION:
--------------------------
   Vector A: [0.8, 0.2, 0.5]     Vector B: [0.7, 0.3, 0.6]
                     \                   /
                      \                 /
                       Cosine Similarity
                            = 0.984
                    (Very similar texts!)


4. REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
---------------------------
   • Semantic Search: Find documents by meaning, not just keywords
   • Chatbots: Understand user intent regardless of phrasing
   • Recommendation: Suggest similar content based on embeddings
   • Translation: Map meanings across languages
   • Clustering: Group similar documents automatically
   • Classification: Categorize text based on learned patterns


5. KEY INSIGHTS:
----------------
   ✓ Embeddings capture MEANING, not just words
   ✓ Mathematical operations work (king - man + woman ≈ queen)
   ✓ Similar texts have similar vectors
   ✓ Enables ML models to "understand" text
   ✓ Foundation for modern NLP applications
