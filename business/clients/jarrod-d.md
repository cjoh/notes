[2025-08-10] - Rescheduled Monday's standing appointment for Tuesday
[2025-08-07] - Status: 4/10. Just returned home Saturday after leaving Cirque Lodge (treatment attempt #14). Family nervous around him, don't want to "go back to normal." Still believes he can think his way through addiction - extremely resistant to recovery work. Wife has contract: 6 months out if he relapses. Meeting weekly on Mondays. Plans to check in with Freddy tomorrow. High relapse risk given history and resistance.
