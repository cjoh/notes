# LOG
[2025-08-08] - **RED FLAG**: Family conversation reveals concerning depression signs - spending excessive time in bed, not working, withdrawn/avoidant behavior. Significant disconnect between family observations and my coaching sessions. Family concerned. Agreed to push therapy referral and structured scheduling when he returns from vacation (10 days). Need to reassess approach.
[2025-08-07] - Status: 6/10. Good kid but difficult to connect with. Sessions run short (~30 minutes) - hard to sustain conversation. Main focus seems to be finding employment. Limited coaching work needed - may be more of a job placement situation than deep recovery work.
