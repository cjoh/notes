# Case Lessons - Core Values Recovery Coaching

## Family Collateral Information - Ryan J Case (August 2025)

**Key Learning**: Clients may present very differently in coaching sessions versus their daily functioning at home.

### Situation
- **Client Presentation**: Ryan J appeared stable in recovery, primary concern seemed to be job searching
- **Session Quality**: Short sessions (~30 min), hard to sustain conversation, limited engagement
- **Initial Assessment**: "Good kid" needing practical job placement support rather than intensive coaching

### Family Reality Check
- **Family Observations**: Spending excessive time in bed, not working, withdrawn/avoidant behavior
- **Severity Gap**: Significant disconnect between coaching session presentation and home functioning
- **Depression Indicators**: Classic signs of depression that weren't apparent in structured sessions

### Clinical Insights
1. **Masking in Sessions**: Clients often put on their "best face" for providers while struggling significantly in daily life
2. **Communication Challenges**: What appeared to be personality/engagement issues were likely depression symptoms
3. **Employment Barriers**: Job search difficulties may be symptoms of underlying depression rather than practical obstacles

### Practice Improvements
- **Family Check-ins**: Essential for younger clients or those with limited session engagement
- **Collateral Information**: Family observations provide crucial data points coaching sessions might miss
- **Deeper Screening**: Need systematic depression screening even with seemingly stable clients
- **Reassess Quickly**: When family input conflicts with session observations, immediate case reassessment required

### Action Protocol
1. Therapy referral for professional depression assessment
2. Structured daily scheduling to combat isolation/avoidance
3. More direct depression screening in future sessions
4. Continue family collaboration as information source

**Takeaway**: Trust but verify - client presentation in structured sessions doesn't always reflect daily functioning reality. Family involvement can be diagnostic gold.
