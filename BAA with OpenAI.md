**In a few paragraphs, please provide a detailed description of your use cases:**

The core values platform is a system that allows for interventionists, therapists, case managers, recovery coaches and other behavioral health professionals to work together to help people with alcohol use disorder or substance use disorder into long-term recovery. Our platform uses LLMs to:

1. Generate case summaries on a weekly basis, based on notes that have been taken by those various professionals, to get everyone on the same page.
2. Synthesize information from breathalyzer data, evaluations, biometric devices like the oura ring, and other assessments to give summary data to the recovery professionals in each session. 
3. Provide virtual supervision to the professionals, giving them questions to ask families or persons of concern
4. Generate meeting schedules for 12 step meetings and other support group systems.

This tool is for the professionals only. Their clients (families, people with addiction), never interact directly with the LLM.  All outputs from the LLM are reviewed by licensed professionals (when in a care setting) prior to use in any clinical  setting. We intend on using zero data retention with OpenAI. All data will be sent though our secure backend using TLS encrpytion. Our data is encrypted at rest, and wherever possible, we will pseudonymize data transmission to reduce PHI exposure.
