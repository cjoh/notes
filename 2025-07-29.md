Help me write a new application to initialize claude projects. There should be two repositories in this project. The first, which we will call ai_assets will be a repository of claude code slash commands, agents, and other items that are useful in a claude code project.

The next is called ceecee. Ceecee is a command line application that allows the user to select the items from the ai_assets directory to copy into the current project's file. ceecee should be able to use any github link as a potential repository for the assets, or a local destination (like the ai_assets folder). 

First, act as a product designer and think through the user experience and requirements of the app at the CLI level. Then think through the technical requirements. Then once that is done, begin technical implementation.
